    "\n",
    "Given a sequence of monocular images and their corresponding camera poses estimated by a SLAM system, NeuralRecon incrementally reconstructs **local geometry in a view-independent 3D volume instead of view-dependent depth maps**. Specifically, it **unprojects the image features to form a 3D feature volume** and then uses sparse convolutions to process the feature volume to output a sparse TSDF volume.\n",
    "\n",
    "With a coarse-to-fine design, the predicted TSDF is gradually refined at each level. By directly reconstructing the implicit surface (TSDF), the network is able to learn the local smoothness and global shape prior of natural 3D surfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make the current-fragment reconstruction to be globally consistent with the previously reconstructed fragments, a $\\mathbf{learning-based\\ TSDF\\ fusion\\ module\\ using\\ the\\ Gated\\ Recurrent\\ Unit\\ (GRU)}$ is proposed. The GRU fusion makes the current-fragment reconstruction conditioned on the previously reconstructed global volume, yielding a joint reconstruction and fusion approach. As a result, the reconstructed mesh is dense, accurate and globally coherent in scale. Furthermore, predicting the volumetric representation also removes the redundant computation in depth-based methods, which allows us to use a larger 3D CNN while maintaining the real-time performance.\n",

    "#### Image Feature Volume Construction\n",
    "\n",
    "The N images in the local fragment are first passed through the image backbone to extract the multi-level features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to previous works on volumetric reconstruction [18, 15, 30], the extracted features are back-projected along each ray into the 3D feature volume. \n",
    "\n",
    "The image feature volume $F^l_t$ is obtained by **averaging** the features from different views according to the visibility weight of each voxel. \n",
    "\n",
    "The visibility weight is defined as the number of views from which a voxel can be observed in the local fragment. A visualization of this unprojection process can be found in Fig.3 i.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Coarse to Fine TSDF Reconstruction\n",
    "\n",
    "We adopt a coarse-to-fine approach to gradually refine the predicted TSDF volume at each level. \n",
    "\n",
    "We use 3D sparse convolution to efficiently process the feature volume $F^l_t$. \n",
    "\n",
    "The sparse volumetric representation also naturally integrates with the coarse-to-fine design. \n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, each voxel in the TSDF volume $S^l_t$ contains two values, the occupancy score $o$ and the SDF value $x$. At each level, both $o$ and $x$ are predicted by the\n",
    "MLP. \n",
    "\n",
    "The occupancy score represents the confidence of a voxel being within the TSDF truncation distance $\\lambda$. \n",
    "\n",
    "The voxel whose occupancy score is lower than the sparsification threshold Î¸ is defined as void space and will be sparsified. \n",
    "\n",
    "This representation of sparse TSDF volume is visually illustrated in Fig.3 iii. \n",
    "\n",
    "After the sparsification, $S^l_t$ is upsampled by 2Ã and concatenated with the $F^{l+1}_t$ as the input for the GRU Fusion module (introduced later) in the next level. \n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of estimating single-view depth maps for each\n",
    "key frame, NeuralRecon jointly reconstructs the implicit surface within the bounding volume of the local fragment\n",
    "window. \n",
    "\n",
    "This design guides the network to learn the natural surface prior directly from the training data. \n",
    "\n",
    "As a result,the reconstructed surface is locally smooth and coherent in scale. \n",
    "\n",
    "Notably, this design also leads to less redundant computation compared to depth-based methods since each area on the 3D surface is estimated only once during the fragment reconstruction.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### GRU Fusion\n",
    "To make the reconstruction consistent between fragments, we propose to make the current-fragment reconstruction to be conditioned on the reconstructions in previous fragments. We use a 3D convolutional variant of Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) [6] module for this purpose. As illustrated in Fig.3 ii, at each level the image feature\n",
    "volume $F^l_t$ is first passed through the 3D sparse convolution layers to extract 3D geometric features $G^l_t$. The hidden state $H^l_{tâ1}$ is extracted from the global hidden state $H^g_{tâ1}$ within the fragment bounding volume. GRU fuses $G^l_t$ with hidden state $H^l_{tâ1}$ and produces the updated hidden state $H^l_t$, which will be passed through the MLP layers to predict the TSDF volume $S^l_t$ at this level. The hidden state $H^l_t$ will\n",
    "also be updated to global hidden state $H^g_t$ by directly replacing the corresponding voxels. Formally, denoting $z_t$ as the update gate, $r_t$ as the reset gate, $\\sigma$ as the sigmoid function and $W_â$ as the weight for sparse convolution, GRU fuses $G^l_t$ with hidden state $H^l_{tâ1}$ with the following operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\\\[ \n",
    "z_t = \\sigma(SparseConv([H^l_{tâ1}, G^l_t], W_z)) \\\\\n",
    "r_t = \\sigma(SparseConv([H^l_{tâ1}, G^l_t], W_r)) \\\\\n",
    "\\tilde{H}^l_t = tanh(SparseConv([r_t \\odot H^l_{tâ1}, G^l_t], W_h)) \\\\\n",
    "H^l_t = (1 â z_t) \\odot H^l_{tâ1} + z_t \\odot \\tilde{H}^l_t \\\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Intuitively, in the context of joint reconstruction and fusion of TSDF, the update gate $z_t$ and forget gate $r_t$ in the GRU determine how much information from the previous reconstructions (i.e. hidden state $H^l_{tâ1}$) is fused to the current-fragment geometric feature $G^l_t$, as well as how much information from the current-fragment will be fused into the hidden state H^l_t. As a data-driven approach, the GRU serves as a selective attention mechanism that replaces the linear running-average operation in conventional TSDF fusion [31]. By predicting $S^l_t$ after the GRU, the MLP network can leverage the context information accumulated from history fragments to produce consistent surface geometry across local fragments. This is also conceptually analogous to the depth filter in a non-learning-based 3D reconstruction pipeline [38, 34], where the current observation\n",
    "and the temporally-fused depths are fused with the Bayesian filter. The effectiveness of joint reconstruction and fusion is validated in the ablation study.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Integration to the Global TSDF Volume\n",
    "At the last coarse-to-fine level, $S^3_t$ is predicted and further sparsified to $S^l_t$. Since the fusion between $S^l_t$ and $S^g_t$ has been done in GRU Fusion, $S^l_t$ is integrated into $S^g_t$ by directly replacing the corresponding voxels after being transformed into the global coordinate. At each time step t, Marching Cubes is\n",

    "The SDF loss is defined as the $l1$ distance between the predicted SDF values and the ground-truth SDF values. We\n",
